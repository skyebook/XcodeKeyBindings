# Xcode Key Bindings

Every time I find myself at a new computer I'm driven crazy by not seeing Xcode's **Show Document Items** pop up when I hit `⌥⌘O`.  So I've decided to put my key bindings under source control.

## Installation

Drop the `keybindings` file into `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/KeyBindings` and restart Xcode.
